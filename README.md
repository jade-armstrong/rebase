# Rebase
This is a simple bash script to update your main branch and rebase. This is useful to prevent you from rebasing to an outdated main.

Step 1: Download the script.
Step 2: Replace the comment with your main github email for gpg signing.
Step 3: Install the script from the folder you downloaded it to:
`sudo install rebase.sh ~bin/rebase`
Step 4: Run `rebase` in the terminal whenever you want to rebase to the main branch.
